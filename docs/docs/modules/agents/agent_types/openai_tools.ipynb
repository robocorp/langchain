    "Certain OpenAI models have been finetuned to work with with **tool calling**. This is very similar but different from **function calling**, and thus requires a separate agent type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between tools and functions lies in their availability and application within the chat environment. **Tools** are specialized capabilities directly accessible in the chat interface, designed for interactive and immediate use, such as generating images or executing code. In contrast, **functions** are more about invoking specific computational tasks or algorithms, typically as part of a larger process or application. This distinction underscores the tailored nature of each tool and function, ensuring they are optimally suited for their respective roles within the chat environment."
