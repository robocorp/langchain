      # We want to keep this build stage *separate* from the release stage,
      # so that there's no sharing of permissions between them.
      # The release stage has trusted publishing and GitHub repo contents write access,
      # and we want to keep the scope of that access limited just to the release job.
      # Otherwise, a malicious `build` step (e.g. via a compromised dependency)
      # could get access to our GitHub or PyPI credentials.
      #
      # Per the trusted publishing GitHub Action:
      # > It is strongly advised to separate jobs for building [...]
      # > from the publish job.
