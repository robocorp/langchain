    "- Lots functionality around using AgentExecutor, including: [using it as an iterator](./how_to/agent_iter), [handle parsing errors](./how_to/handle_parsing_errors), [returning intermediate steps](./how_to/itermediate_steps), [capping the max number of iterations](./how_to/max_iterations), and [timeouts for agents](./how_to/max_time_limit)\n",
